# Preamble

We, the sons and daughters of the land of Europa and Japheth, heirs of a millenary heritage and custodians of a history full of light and shadow, come together at this happy dawn of a new age to proclaim with fervour and solemnity the birth of an unbreakable union between our nations.

Conscious of our role in history and of our duty to humanity, we pledge ourselves to forge a common destiny, while respecting our different identities, and to cultivate the dream of a Europe united, free and just.

Europe, the child of reforms, revolutions and resistances, was forged by the fire of the struggles for freedom and the unshakeable will of those who, even in the darkest moments, believed in a future of brotherhood and dignity. 

We pay tribute to those generations who sacrificed their future for our present: may their memory be the beacon that guides us and the warning that reminds us of the price and value of freedom and justice. They are not gifts that fell from heaven, but conquests wrested from the darkness of tyranny by those who came before us.

Like kindred souls destined to meet, our fatherlands today join in a fraternal embrace, pledging allegiance to one another in the bright days of glory and the dark hours of trial, in the grandeur of prosperity and the challenges of adversity. 

We celebrate the great diversity of our peoples, as in a sublime musical composition, where every note contributes to the overall harmony, and where no voice is mute or dissonant, but each is an essential part of a common song.

We bind ourselves in a covenant of fraternity and solidarity, pledging ourselves to share the resources of our lands and the ingenuity of our peoples, to help each other in times of need, and to strive together for the moral and material advancement of every European citizen. 

In this noble bond we recognise the duty of each nation to make its own unique contribution to the progress of Europe, and of Europe to co-operate in a spirit of equality and mutual respect with other continents and other cultures for the continuing betterment of all mankind.

We pledge ourselves to honour and defend with unquenchable zeal the principles of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, which unite us, recognising in them not only the foundation of our Union but also our contribution to the noble cause of humanity. 

We firmly believe that each individual has the duty and the right to make a difference, and that Europe is the privileged space of human hope in which this principle should find its full recognition.

Putting aside the ancient feuds that have stained our soil with blood and tears, we now look towards the horizon of a common future in which Europe, strong in its unity in diversity, can walk side by side with other continents, as sister among sisters, towards an era of peace and mutual understanding. 

This journey does not stop at our borders, but calls us to contribute to the betterment of the entire human family, aware that our responsibility is not limited to our continent, but embraces the planet and every living creature that inhabits it.

That is why we are committed to protecting the planet that hosts us, aware that the Earth is not a possession, but a loan received from past generations and a gift to be handed down intact to future ones.

Our Europe is not and never will be a goal achieved once and for all, but rather a promise in the making, an unfinished work that each generation is called to build: we therefore commit ourselves to protecting the political agency of our peoples, so that no individual is a passive spectator, but a conscious agent of his or her own destiny. 

We therefore make a heartfelt appeal to future generations never to cease fighting for justice, freedom and human dignity, for the greatness of Europe lies not in its walls or borders, but in the strength of its ideals and the will of each generation to make a difference.

By this solemn act we, the peoples of Europe, unite ourselves in an indissoluble political, economic and spiritual marriage, in the firm conviction that through this profound integration we will be able to realise our highest aspirations and contribute, together with the other peoples of the world, to building a fairer and more harmonious future for all.

May this happy union, born of our free will and common destiny, withstand the trials of time, flourish through the ages, and inspire fraternal cooperation among all peoples, testifying to the possibility of universal harmony while respecting individual identities, with a view to the unity of the great human family.
